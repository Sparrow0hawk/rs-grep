Call miracle self-healing:
The utter, self-revealing
Double-take of feeling.
If thereâ€™s fire on the mountain
Or lightning and storm
And a god speaks from the sky
That means someone is hearing
The outcry and the birth-cry
Of new life at its term.
It means once in a lifetime
That justice can rise up
And hope and history rhyme.
